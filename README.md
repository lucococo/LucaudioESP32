# LucaudioESP32

_Project inspired by [sonocotta ESP audio docks.](https://github.com/sonocotta/esp32-audio-dock/tree/main)_

I wanted a solution for wireless audio multiroom synchronized players, and the best I found was projects using [squeezelite-esp32](https://github.com/sle118/squeezelite-esp32).

I did my own board because firstly I wanted to improve my cad skills, and also because I like bringing my own personnal touch.
Project is still in development, I'm adding new features on my pcb later on
