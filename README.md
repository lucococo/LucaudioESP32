Project inspired by sonocotta ESP audio docks. 
I wanted a solution for wireless audio multiroom synchronized players, and the best I found was projects using squeezelite.

I did my own board because firstly I wanted to improve my cad skills, and also because I like bringing my own personnal touch.

Project is still in development, I'm adding new features on my pcb later on
